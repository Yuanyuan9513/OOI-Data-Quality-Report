# OOI-Data-Quality-Report
This report summarizes a data quality review of the Pioneer Coastal Central Inshore Profiler Mooring (CP02PMCI). I focus on data from the Deployments 3 and 4 (2015-04-30 to 2016-05-20), and compare the profiler's dissolved oxygen data with cruise data collected just one day after the 4th deployment of the profiler mooring.
